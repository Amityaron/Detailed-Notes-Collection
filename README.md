# Detailed-Notes-Collection
I have collected all of the detailed notes I wrote during my studies at HebrewU as well as courses I studied independently, and published them as a part of my goal to make Data Science & Quantitative trade topics more accessible to Hebrew speakers.</br>
This collection contains detailed notes in Hebrew on subjects such as Math (Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability, Discrete Math) 
and advanced statistical methods(GLM, Computational Methods in Nonlinear Optimization, Information theory, Nonparametric statistics)</br>
foundations of Computer Science (Data Structures, Algorithms, Complexity), as well as advanced Data Science (Machine Learning,).</br>
