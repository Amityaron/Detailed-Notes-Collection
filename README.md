# Detailed-Notes-Collection
I have collected all of the detailed notes I wrote during my studies at HebrewU as well as courses I studied independently, and published them as a part of my goal to make Data Science & Quantitative trade topics more accessible to Hebrew speakers.</br>
This collection contains detailed notes in Hebrew on subjects such as Math (Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability, Discrete Math)</br>
and Advanced Statistical Methods(GLM, Computational Methods in Nonlinear Optimization, Information theory, Nonparametric statistics)</br>
Foundations of Computer Science (Data Structures, Algorithms, Complexity), as well as advanced Data Science (Machine Learning,).</br>
